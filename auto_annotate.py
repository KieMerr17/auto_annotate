categories = {
    "Failed to Accelerate": "The car is stopped and fails to start when it should; it doesn't move away from stationary. This can occur at traffic lights, when merging into traffic, or when attempting to start from a stop sign. Consequences may include blocking traffic or causing unsafe situations behind the vehicle.",
    "Failed to Slow": "The car does not slow down when required (e.g., for traffic lights, other vehicles, pedestrians, or generally going too fast for the situation). This could result in near misses with pedestrians crossing the street or rear-end collisions in stop-and-go traffic.",
    "Failed to Remain Stopped": "The car starts moving when it should stay stationary, such as at a stop sign or red light. This may include situations where the vehicle incorrectly attempts to move off before it is safe, potentially endangering pedestrians or oncoming traffic.",
    "Failed to Maintain Speed": "The car fails to maintain a consistent speed or does not increase its speed when required. This may happen when navigating hills or during acceleration after a stop, leading to dangerous conditions on highways or merging lanes.",
    "Failed to Follow Route": "The car fails to follow the intended route, makes incorrect lane changes, or uses wrong indicators. This can result in unexpected maneuvers that may confuse other drivers or lead to missed exits.",
    "Failed to Overtake": "The car fails to go around an obstruction, vehicle, cyclist, or other things such as a double-parked car or bus. This can create dangerous situations, especially in traffic where a timely overtake is critical to avoid collisions.",
    "Failed for Early Turn": "The car turns too early or too soon, cutting the corner. This may lead to encroaching on pedestrian walkways or intersecting traffic unexpectedly, posing risks to other road users.",
    "Failed for Late Turn": "The car turns wide, turns late, or straightens the steering wheel too late, potentially crossing into other lanes or creating hazards for vehicles behind or alongside.",
    "Failed for Lane Position": "The car drifts within its lane or fails to maintain proper lane position, which can lead to side-swipe accidents or confusion for other drivers about the vehicle's intentions.",
    "Uncommanded Disengagement": "The autonomous system disengages without any input from the operator, which may happen during critical driving situations, leading to loss of control and increased risk of accidents.",
    "End of Run": "A disengagement to mark the end of the testing session, which should occur safely and without abrupt actions. The end of run signal should be clear and should not confuse other road users.",
    "Failed to Initiate Maneuver": "The car fails to start a required maneuver (e.g., a required lane change). This may happen during merging or when a prompt for a turn is given, risking accidents if other drivers do not anticipate the carâ€™s actions.",
    "Close Proximity": "Disengaging for safety reasons while stationary due to something coming within close proximity of the vehicle, such as another vehicle, cyclist, or pedestrian, which may indicate a lack of awareness of surroundings.",
    "Lens Obscured": "A camera or sensor is blurred, affecting the vehicle's perception. This can lead to misinterpretation of surroundings, potentially resulting in incorrect speed or direction adjustments.",
    "Unprompted Maneuver": "The car performs a maneuver without a clear prompt, which could confuse passengers or other road users. Examples include sudden lane changes or unexpected turns.",
    "Lane Change": "Issues related to failing to change lanes as required, which can create hazards when merging or navigating traffic. This may involve ignoring indicators or misjudging the speed of nearby vehicles.",
    "Emergency Stop": "The vehicle operator makes an emergency stop to avoid danger. This is critical for preventing collisions but can lead to sudden disruptions in traffic flow.",
    "Accidental AVSO Intervention": "Unintentional intervention by the safety operator, possibly due to a false alarm or misinterpretation of a situation. This can disrupt the flow of autonomous operation and may confuse other road users.",
    "Uncategorized": "Situations that don't fit into other categories, often requiring further analysis to determine the appropriate classification.",
    "Diversion": "The plotted route cannot be driven on, so the operator is required to divert from the route. This may involve unexpected turns or navigating unfamiliar roads, which could impact safety.",
    "Emergency Service": "The vehicle interacts with emergency services (e.g., yielding to an ambulance). This requires quick and decisive action to clear the way, ensuring that emergency responders can reach their destination promptly."
