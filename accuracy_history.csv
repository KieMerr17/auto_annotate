"The driving error of 'drifting in lane' refers to the behavior of a driver when they are not staying centered within their lane of travel. This can result in the vehicle drifting towards the edge of the lane or into neighboring lanes, increasing the risk of a collision with other vehicles on the road. This behavior is dangerous as it can lead to accidents and puts both the driver and others on the road at risk. It is important for drivers to stay attentive and focused on maintaining their position within their designated lane while driving.",Failed for Lane Position,100.0,,,
"Drifting in lane refers to a situation where a driver is not maintaining a consistent position within their lane of travel. This could involve swerving from side to side within the lane, crossing over into adjacent lanes, or straddling the dividing lines. It is a dangerous driving error that can result in collisions with other vehicles or objects on the road.",Failed for Lane Position,100.0,,,
"This means that the driver was driving too closely to a cyclist who was on the right side of the road. Driving closely to a cyclist poses a danger to both the cyclist and the driver, as it increases the risk of a collision. Drivers should always maintain a safe distance from cyclists to ensure everyone's safety on the road.",Failed for Lane Position,100.0,,,
This means that the driver did not reduce their speed or stop their vehicle to allow a person who was waiting to cross the road to do so safely. This is a dangerous and potentially harmful driving error that can put pedestrians at risk of being hit by a vehicle. Drivers should always be aware of their surroundings and be prepared to yield to pedestrians when necessary.,Failed for Lane Position,0.0,,,
"This driving error refers to the failure of a driver to reduce their speed when approaching an intersection with an amber (yellow) traffic light. The amber light is a signal for drivers to slow down and prepare to stop, as the light is about to turn red. Ignoring the amber light and driving through the intersection without slowing down can lead to potential accidents and violation of traffic laws. Drivers are advised to always be prepared to stop when they see an amber light.",Failed for Lane Position,0.0,,,
